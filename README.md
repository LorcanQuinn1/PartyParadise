# Party-Paradise

Party Paradise is a Travel Agency business specifically for students to travel abroad more affordably, gain new experiences and meet new people.

Objective

Our purpose is to allow students who are looking to travel the opportunity to do so by bringing the experience for less. This allows cash strapped students who would otherwise not be able to travel the opportunity to do so.
